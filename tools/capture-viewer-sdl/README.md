# SDL reference viewer

The default mode creates synthetic frames and consumes them through Jackstay's
public C API in the same process. This mode needs no porthole daemon. The existing
SDL rendering path remains available to Katzensteg's SDL interception.

From the Jackstay checkout:

```sh
./scripts/smoke-viewer.sh
```

Leave `--frames` off the resulting `build/viewer/capture-viewer-sdl` command to
keep the window open. `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` supports offline synthetic checks;
it is not a substitute for real desktop capture evidence.

## External library build

Build Jackstay first, with `--features backend-macos` on macOS. CMake defaults to
the current Jackstay checkout's headers and debug library. For an installed or
separately built library, pass both locations:

```sh
cmake -S tools/capture-viewer-sdl -B build/viewer \
  -DJACKSTAY_LIB=/absolute/path/to/libjackstay.dylib \
  -DJACKSTAY_INCLUDE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/jackstay/include
cmake --build build/viewer
ctest --test-dir build/viewer --output-on-failure
```

Linux uses `libjackstay.so`. The CTest smoke checks 30 generated frames through
the C ABI and SDL software renderer. It fails on missing/corrupt frames or renderer
failure. The library and viewer support synthetic operation on macOS/Linux; the
SDL native presenter uses Metal and rejects `--native` on Linux. Linux native
import/sync verification lives in the Vulkan reference consumer checks.

## Optional porthole integration

These modes require a separately installed and authorized porthole. They are not
needed to build or test the standalone example.

`--porthole-socket PATH` creates a porthole synthetic capture session; adding
`--session-id ID` attaches to an existing CPU session instead. The library's
optional porthole client uses `PORTHOLE_AGENT_TOKEN` when applicable. The host
remains responsible for capture permission, source selection and session cleanup.

For a real macOS native capture session, keep porthole running as its installed
launchd job so it owns its attach MachService. Use porthole's capture-session
command to obtain the endpoint and attach token, then supply them to the viewer:

```sh
./build/viewer/capture-viewer-sdl --native \
  --transport-kind 1 --endpoint "$attach_endpoint" --token "$attach_token" \
  --frames 120
```

Transport kind 1 is the macOS XPC endpoint; `--mach-service NAME` also selects it.
Use values returned by the host, not guessed surface handles or IDs. Consult the
porthole native-viewer smoke for its complete authorized session lifecycle.
Frame presentation waits on the transferred Metal fence and releases the acquired
lease after rendering. Native capture needs separate live validation; the offline
synthetic test makes no claim about GPU copies or desktop permissions.
